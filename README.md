I love coding so much, sometimes I even do it for fun! For example, last summer I implemented a chip-8 emulator in Java so I could learn about low-level computer architecture. The chip-8 is a programming language that was popular in the 1980’s to play games like Pong, Tetris, or Space Invaders on those tall arcade towers which are now a thing of the past. Developing the emulator was my first introduction to software components like the program counter, registers, and opcodes. I started slowly implementing the opcodes, but as I got more comfortable with binary operations and memory address manipulation, I completed the 35 opcodes and moved on to graphics. I’m most proud of this side project because it was completely independent. Although I do prefer working in teams, especially for software development, I’m confident in my ability to figure something out on my own. This side project also gave me a leg up in my computer architecture class I took in the subsequent school term.
